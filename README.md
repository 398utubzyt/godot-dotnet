A GDExtension port of Godot's .NET functionality with the aim of being as compatible as possible.

## Versioning

This repository uses the same branch naming-scheme as the [official Godot repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/):

- `main` tracks the absolute latest changes, but is very unstable.
- `4.x` (any numbered branch) tracks the latest labelled version of that branch.

> **Note**
> 
> There is no planned `3.x` support, as GDExtension is a `4.x` API.
